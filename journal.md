    We are working in class today on getting git installed, but I already did the assignments, not knowing that we were going to work on them in class. I built a fun little age guesser program. I tried to make it efficent and effective in the shortest amount of time possible, and it worked well. I want continue to work more in vs code with sticking to keyboard commands only and have little to no mouse use when writing code, and to continue to learn vim keybinds. I didn't write in vim, but this was a small enough project- maybe I should have. I feel pretty comfortable with the basics of git, and I look forward to learning more about the production part-checkouts, merge conficts and resolutions, etc.
